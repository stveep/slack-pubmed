## Pubmed searches for Slack

This utility searches PubMed for a list of search terms, and inserts the results into a Slack channel via an appropriate webhook.

I wrote this mostly to teach myself some Python---you have been warned. Any comments/improvements welcome!

### Usage

- Set up a webhook in Slack for the channel to post to. 
- Set an environment variable `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` with the URL.
- Set your search terms (currently done by editing the `pubmed_slack.py` script.
- Run `python pubmed_slack.py`.
- Your search result will appear in the channel, with link to Pubmed and a random emoji.
